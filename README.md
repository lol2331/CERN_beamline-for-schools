This repository has raspberry pi projects that will be used to test the endurace and/or the breaking point of a raspberry pi under the effects of radiation. There are programs that read data from a sensor(IMU, camera), write data in a document and a project that tracks the iss in real time. This programs can be run from a terminal connected via WI-FI to a raspberry pi or in the traditional way.
